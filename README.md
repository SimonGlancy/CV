# Simon Glancy

After years of pursuing the rock and roll dream, I found myself drawn towards the world of programming and the opportunities it gave me to use the analytical and creative sides of my brain. I took a huge gamble to quit my job in Civil Engineering and take an intensive 12 week bootcamp at Makers Academy. As of Jan 2016 I had not written a single line of code, fast forward to May 2016 I have completed a working prototype for a mobile deliveries app.

I am looking for a fertile environment that will allow me to table new ideas and see them through to fruition. I am particularly interested in products that are intrinsically useful and are disrupting the way that we interact with our surroundings.



## Skills

### Test Driving Software Development

Through my experience at Makers Academy I have really bought into the concept of test driven development not only in how it allows you to monitor the state of your code as you develop new features but more importantly how it often leads you down the path to clean readable code.

As my knowledge of object oriented design and extreme programming has grown so to has my love of refactoring. This was particularly evident to me in my final project where extracting services to deal with the location and directions api actions allowed me to easily reuse the functionality in different controllers.

### User Focussed Design

I am a huge fan of clean design both in an aesthetic sense and also how products fulfill their purpose. It is what I spend the most time on, developing the why and teasing out the most elegant solution.

### Analysis and problem-solving

From playing Zelda on the N64 I have always loved games and logic puzzles. In my previous job I spent considerable time trying to gamify work streams and develop systems that made monotonous tasks fascinating and easy to monitor progress, this is ultimately what gave me the push to try programming.

When it comes to programming I love to break things apart and see if they can fit back together in new ways.

### Teamwork

I love working in teams and pairing is something which I'm very passionate about. I think my strengths lie in being able to tease out the best from the people around me. I'm very high energy at the start of a project and love to lead when the team is being shaped and the direction decided. Through years of working in high pressure technical environments I have developed the knowledge on when to step forward and lead and when to be lead. I am a strong believer in positive tension.

### Working to perform

I have found the experience of being in a band and playing to both big crowds and empty rooms has greatly affected my abilities in the workplace. It has given me the skills to present to people, integrate into teams and the confidence to be client facing.
